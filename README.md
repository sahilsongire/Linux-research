Little did he knew that Linux will go worldwide and be the undisputed king of low end systems......

THINGS to consider:-
Things to consider before using linux.
    • It is case-sensitive(so be careful with spellings).
    • It can pretty much run on any possible hardware containing CPU,RAM,Storage and power.
    • It is not that hard to use,Once you get used to it.Its just becomes second nature and you won’t even realise it 
    • Be Careful with the terminal.(its really easy to mess up if you are new so read few guides before touching the terminal).
    • Keep track of your daily driving linux so that you can see where you made mistakes and corrected them.
    • Keep updated with the community.(Linux community is really wide to ask any doubt,Ask any help they will help you right away).


LINUX DISTRO’s to try as Beginners:-

Linux Mint:-
Linux mint is the perfect beginner friendly distro for regular use if you start using it you won’t feel any difference its like a proper copy of windows except its lightweight and doesn’t go dumb when something happens.

It just plain works on any possible machine.

Its interface looks like this.....

Heavily inspired by the early XP days.....

Ways of installation:-
There are lots of ways to install linux but i will recommend a safe one.
    1. Prepare a usb stick to use mint ISO file.I would recommend use ventoy.It is a handy tool which you can use to make a bootable Pendrive without formatting it everytime.
    ventoy site:- https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html

This is their site read if you want to......
2. Next download the Mint iso from their official site,which looks like this......
